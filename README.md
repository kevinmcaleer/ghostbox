There is a writeup of this project over at Kevsrobots.com - <https://www.kevsrobots.com/blog/ghostbox.html> where you can also download the STL files, and find the bill of materials.

There are 4 files that will need copying over to the Pico:

* `ghostbox.jpg`
* `ghostbox.py`
* `ghostwords.txt`
* `gui.py`

You can make the Pico automatically launch the ghostbox.py code by renaming it to main.py on the Pico.

You can also add more words to the `ghostwords.txt` to increase the vocabulary.ÃŸ
